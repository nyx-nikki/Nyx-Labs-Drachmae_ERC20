Notes:


I have managed to develop and deploy a prototype ERC20 token & blockchain to the Ropsten test network.
What I would like is for someone (potentially you) to review my code (or write a better one) and then deploy the finished token and blockchain to the Ethereum mainnet so that it becomes eligible for trade using MetaMask for starters. In further steps I'd like the token to be verified on etherscan. I'd also like it tied in to the Infura.io API.
Does this make sense?


The token is called "Drachmae"
The Symbol is DAE
The total supply should be 420,000,000.0000 (four hundred twenty million. four decimal spots)
Initial supply should be 4,200,000.000 (four point two million)
Token should be mintable
Token should be pausable
Token should have a transfer fee.
Token should be not burnable
Basically, I know that services like https://tokenmint.io/ and https://www.togen.io/ offer similar services.
I would however like it to be done by a human that can later explain the process to me.
